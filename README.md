# Lumina - Modern Developer Portfolio

Lumina is a high-performance, aesthetically driven developer portfolio template.

## 🚀 Deployment (Zero Config)
This version is optimized for instant deployment.

1.  Upload `index.html` and `metadata.json` to your GitHub repository.
2.  Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3.  Set the source to the `main` branch (root).
4.  Your site is live!

**Note**: All logic is contained within `index.html` using Babel Standalone. This allows the site to run without a build step (npm build) while still using React and TypeScript syntax.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React 18 (via CDN)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
-   **Icons**: Lucide React
-   **Routing**: React Router (HashRouter)

Built with ❤️ for the developer community.
